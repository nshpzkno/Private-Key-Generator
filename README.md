# Private-Key-Generator
'Private Key Generator' made by me in Python (Works for RapidGator, Mega, Uploaded, Turbobit, Uloz.to and many other services). Feel free to use it anyhow you want :)

How to use:

1. Download generator.py
2. Create links.txt and premium.txt files inside the same folder
3. Put all of your non-premium links inside the links.txt file (each link to a separate line)
4. Run generator.py
5. Your premium links will be generated in to the premium.txt file
6. Now, the only thing left is to insert the generated links into JDownload and download your files or download the links directly from the browser (the link to download JDownload is here: https://jdownloader.org/download/index)

P.S.: Sometimes there is an error, and not every link is generated, if something like this happens, repeat the proces with only the uncreated links in the links.txt file. If you are creating many links at once I recommend to use VPN or Proxy, which you will change periodically.
