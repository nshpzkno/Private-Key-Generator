# Private-Key-Generator
'Private Key Generator' made by me in Python (Works for RapidGator, Mega, Uploaded, Turbobit, Uloz.to and many other services). Feel free to use it anyhow you want :)

How to use:

1. Download generator.py
2. Create links.txt and premium.txt files in to the same folder
3. Put all of your non-premium links in to the links.txt file (each link to a separate line)
4. Run generator.py
5. Your premium links will be generated in to the premium.txt file

P.S.: Sometimes there is an error, and not every link is generated, if something like this happens, repeat the proces with only the uncreated links in the links.txt file. If you are creating many links at once I recommend to use VPN or Proxie, which you will change periodically.
